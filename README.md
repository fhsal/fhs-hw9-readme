Link to recording of working application as specified in assignment instructions:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l3yHnle-B5GIuBNdQdOVXEHd8R0WCAHS/view

Summary:  This is a command-line application to be run using Node to generate a good readMe file - which includes the following:

(1) Table of Contents, where each entry has a link to the associated area within the sampleReadMe file which is generated by the application 

(2) Sections within the sampleReadMe which contain the answers to the inputs requested by the application, including Title, Description, Licensing, Installation, 
    Contributors, Testing, Usage and a Questions are with contact info and link to the user's GitHub profile
    
(3) The application prompts the user for inputs, has some logic to match the licensing badge and licensing text associated with the licensing chosen and then takes the content instantiated in the template literal and writes the sampleReadMe.md file.
